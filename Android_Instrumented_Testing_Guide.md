## Introduction to Android Instrumented Tests
Android Instrumented Tests are tests that run on Android hardware or emulators, allowing developers to test the application's interface and functionality as it would operate in a real-world scenario.

## Purpose of Android Instrumented Tests
- **Real Environment Testing**: They provide a platform for testing the app in an environment similar to that of the end users.
- **UI and Integration Testing**: Ideal for testing user interfaces and the integration between different components of the application.

## Libraries Used in Android Instrumented Tests
- **Espresso**: For UI testing, providing APIs to simulate user interactions and test the UI.
- **JUnit**: For structuring tests and assertions.
- **Mockito**: For creating mocks and stubs in tests.

## Example from Provided Files
### `BillsScreenTest.kt`
- **Purpose**: Tests the Bills screen UI and interactions.
- **Key Components**:
    - Using Espresso to simulate user interactions.
    - JUnit for assertions and test structure.

### `CustomTestRunner.kt`
- **Purpose**: Custom runner to set up the testing environment.
- **Key Components**:
    - Extends AndroidJUnitRunner for custom configurations.

## Best Practices for Android Instrumented Tests
- **Keep Tests Isolated**: Each test should be independent of others.
- **Use Mocks and Stubs**: To simulate complex objects and interactions.
- **Focus on User Experience**: Test from a user's perspective, ensuring UI and functionality meet expectations.

## Conclusion
Android Instrumented Tests are crucial for ensuring that your app behaves correctly in a real-world environment, especially for UI and integration aspects.
