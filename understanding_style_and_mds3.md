# Project Style Guide Using Material Design System 3

## Introduction

This document outlines the style guide for our project, which adheres to the principles of Material Design System 3. Material Design is a design language developed by Google, offering a comprehensive guide for visual, motion, and interaction design across platforms and devices.

## Color Scheme (from `Color.kt`)

Our project uses a vibrant and modern color scheme defined in `Color.kt`. Key colors include:

-   Primary Color: `#8800EB`
-   On Primary: `#FFFFFF`
-   Primary Container: `#F0DBFF`
-   On Primary Container: `#2C0051`
-   Secondary Color: `#655A6F`
-   On Secondary: `#FFFFFF`
-   Secondary Container: `#EDDDF6`

These colors follow the Material Design guidelines for light and dark themes, ensuring accessibility and aesthetic appeal.

## Theming (from `Theme.kt` and `ThemeConstants.kt`)

Theming is implemented using Material Design's theming system. `Theme.kt` and `ThemeConstants.kt` include configurations for light and dark themes, as well as size constants for scalable and responsive design. This approach ensures consistency across different devices and screen sizes.

## Typography (from `Typography.kt`)

Typography in our project is handled in `Typography.kt`, aligning with Material Design's typography guidelines. This file sets the typographic styles for various text elements, ensuring readability and visual harmony.

## Usage of Material Design System 3

Our project utilizes Material Design System 3 to create a cohesive user experience. This includes the use of Material components, responsive layouts, and an emphasis on motion design for interactive elements. The system's flexibility allows us to tailor the design to meet our specific needs while maintaining consistency with Material Design principles.
